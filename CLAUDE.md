Standing rules for this repo.

## Core Deps Are PARENA-First (standing, monorepo-wide)

Founder real-time, 2026-10-01: *"always implement core deps in PARENA — when core deps are missing
always implement the core deps in PARENA first."*

- **When a core dependency is missing** (a codec, a protocol client, an inference engine, a
  parser, a data structure — anything this repo's own functionality stands on), implement it in
  PARENA (`PARENA/stdlib/...`) **first**, before building the feature that needs it. Deps first,
  feature second.
- **If PARENA itself can't express the dep yet**, that gap is the real first task: fix or extend
  PARENA (compiler, emitter, or stdlib), with tests, then build the dep on top. Don't route around it.
- **Third-party tools/binaries are stopgaps, not the answer.** Shelling out to or FFI-binding an
  existing tool is allowed only to unblock a demo, and must be labeled as a stopgap in the code and
  in `EMILY/BACKLOG.md` with a PARENA replacement item. (Example: Piper via subprocess for
  MODE_TYLER TTS, 2026-10-01 — stopgap; the PARENA-native synthesis stack is the real work.)
- **Not a license to reimplement the OS.** Core deps = what the product's own behavior depends on.
  Compilers, kernels, system libraries and the like stay as-is; a repo's own CLAUDE.md may record a
  considered, specific exception (same standard as the LZ4 compression convention).
